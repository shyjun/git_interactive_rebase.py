# Git Interactive Rebase GUI Tool 🚀

🌐 **Live Demo / Project Page:** https://shyjun.github.io/git-interactive-rebase-gui-tool/

**A clean visual GUI for `git rebase -i`** — reorder, squash, split, rephrase, drop, and refine commit history, plus **browse any branch and cherry-pick commits** — all with an intuitive interface.

A Python-based Git Interactive Rebase GUI tool to visually manage commit history. Built with **PySide6**, this tool simplifies the complex process of rewriting Git history with a faster and more visual workflow.

**Keywords:** git rebase gui, interactive rebase tool, git history editor, git squash commits gui, git cherry-pick gui

## ✨ Key Features

### 🪺 History Rewriting

* **Visual Reordering**: Drag and drop commits to reorder your history, or use the **Move Commit** context-menu actions. In multi-select mode, drag a block of adjacent checked commits to a new position together.
* **Interactive Squash**: Squash a commit with its neighbor, or multi-select any range of commits to squash into one — with a dedicated dialog and real-time feedback.
* **Multi-select Actions**: **Select multiple commits**, then apply an action to all of them — **Squash selected commits** (any adjacent range), **Mark selected commits**, **Drop selected commits** (dropped one by one, newest first, with per-commit failure recovery), or **drag a contiguous checked block** to reorder it in one go.
* **Smart Rephrase**: Effortlessly update commit messages without leaving the app.
* **Instant Drop**: Remove unwanted commits with a single click (with preview).
* **Split Commits**: Split a commit's changes into multiple commits.
  * Split every file change into its own commit
  * Split all changes into separate commits
  * Move one file's changes out of a commit
  * Drop one file's changes from a commit
* **Hunk-Level Refinement**: Selectively manipulate individual hunks within a commit.
  * Keep only selected hunks
  * Drop selected hunks
  * Move selected hunks to a new commit
  * Edit hunks using a lightweight patch editor
  * Copy hunk patches to clipboard
* **Revert & Reset**: Revert individual commits, reset hard to any SHA, or **reset HEAD to a commit keeping changes as unstaged** (`git reset --mixed`).
* **Archive Safety**: Logs important commit SHAs (`START_TIME_HEAD`, `BEST_COMMITID`, `Undo`), so you can always recover an earlier state — with visible **failsafe reset** buttons.
* **Marking**: Mark/unmark commits for manual tracking (highlighted in the list).

### 🍒 Cherry-Pick

* **Single commit by SHA**: Cherry-pick one commit via the **Cherry-pick 1 Commit** button.
* **From the branch browser**: Select a commit (or check multiple commits in multi-select mode) in a read-only browse window and inject them into your current branch with **Cherry-pick selected commit(s)**.
* **Oldest-first ordering**: Multi-commit cherry-picks apply oldest to newest so the history stays linear.
* **Pre-flight confirmation**: Shows the exact order the selected commits will be applied in (numbered, with commit subjects and target branch).
* **Smart failure handling**: If a commit fails to apply, you are told *why* (conflict, already applied/no change, or other) with the conflicting files listed. You then choose:
  * **Undo entire cherry-pick** — reset back to the starting state
  * **Skip and continue** with the next commit
  * **Stop and handle manually**
* **Transparent results**: After the operation a summary shows how many commits were cherry-picked / skipped / not applied, with every SHA listed. Nothing is left in a half-finished cherry-pick state.

### 📦 Staged Changes Management

* **Handle Staged Changes dialog**: Repo menu → **Handle Staged Changes…** opens a persistent dialog with actions for staged files. The dialog stays open after each action and refreshes automatically.
* **Commit / Unstage Staged Changes Selectively**: Choose exactly which staged files to commit, amend, or unstage — with file checkboxes, tree view, and live diff preview.
  * **Commit Selected Files** — commit only the checked staged files
  * **Amend HEAD with Selected** — amend only the checked staged files into HEAD
  * **Unstage Selected** — unstage only the checked files (`git reset HEAD -- <files>`)
* **View Staged Diff**: 3-tab diff viewer (Plain, File-wise, Tree-wise) for all staged changes.
* **Unstage All**: Unstage all staged changes (`git reset HEAD`).
* **Discard Staged Changes**: Discard all staged changes with confirmation (`git checkout -- .`).
* **Amend HEAD Commit**: Amend staged changes into HEAD with the commit message pre-filled from HEAD (editable).
* **Stash Changes**: Stash all changes (staged and unstaged).
* **Staged changes warning**: If staged changes exist at startup, the Repo button is highlighted and an info dialog suggests using **Handle Staged Changes**.

### 🔍 Discovery & Navigation

* **Live search & filter**: Instantly find commits while you type.
* **Advanced commit filtering**: Search by **SHA** (short, partial, or full 40-character), **commit message**, **filenames**, or **diff content** (with a per-keystroke debounce and a ≥3 character hint), plus **Match Case**, **Whole Word**, and **Display Only Matching** search options (matching commits are bolded). The **Whole Word** option always starts off on each app launch.
* **Search inside diffs**: Press **Ctrl+F** to search within the currently displayed diff, with match-case, whole-word, and next/previous navigation.
* **File-wise diff viewer**: Browse commit changes file by file for easier review (renames shown as one `old => new` row).
* **Consolidated Diff**: Set a start commit, then diff any range of history (or from HEAD down to any commit) in one combined view.
* **View PR Diff**: Open a read-only **PR Preview** showing the combined branch diff vs its merge-base.
* **Browse Branch**: Open a separate read-only window for *any* other branch's history (with dimmed "viewer" styling so you always know it is read-only), then cherry-pick from it.
* **Browse File Log**: Open a separate read-only window showing the history of a single file, via **Browse File Log…** in the Repo menu or **Browse file log** in the file-wise view's right-click menu. History follows renames (`git log --follow`), and the diff pane is scoped to that file.
* **Browse Log of a Commit**: Open a read-only history window for any commit (SHA or ref), prompted via **Browse Log of a Commit…** in the Repo menu with the number of commits to show.
* **Browse Reflog**: Open a read-only window of the repository's HEAD reflog, with **Copy SHA** and **Show log** actions and double-click to open a commit's history.
* **Browse Stashes**: Open a read-only window of the repository's stash list with an always-visible diff pane, plus **Apply + Keep**, **Apply + Drop**, and **Drop** actions (toolbar buttons and right-click menu) with confirmations and auto-refresh.
* **Find Merge-base**: Compute the merge-base between the current branch and any other branch, with one-click **Copy SHA to clipboard** (Repo menu → **Find Merge-base…**).
* **Apply Patch**: Apply a unified-diff/format-patch file via **Apply Patch…** in the Repo menu. Choose whether the changes are committed (using the patch's own commit message) or left unstaged in the working tree; failures are detected with a dry-run check so the repository is never left partially applied. The original patch file is not modified or deleted.
* **Create Patch**: Export any commit as a format-patch file via **Create Patch** in the commit right-click menu. The patch keeps the commit's own message, so it round-trips through Apply Patch.
* **Create patch(s) from selected commits**: In multi-select mode, the **Perform action on selected commits** menu offers **Consolidated single patch** (all changes combined into one unified-diff file) and **Multiple patches** (one format-patch per commit in a chosen folder).
* **Non-modal viewer windows**: The tabbed View Commit window, PR Diff, and consolidated-diff windows stay open while you keep using the main window — switch freely between them without closing the viewer.

### ⚡ Git Integration

* **Rebase onto**: One-click `git rebase main` / `git rebase master`, or rebase onto any branch/SHA you type.
* **Origin helpers**: `git fetch`, `git reset --hard origin/<branch>`, and `git push --force`.
* **Stash management**: Unstaged changes at startup can be **stashed**, **committed** (per file or all at once), **amended into HEAD**, or **discarded**. The app-created stash is tracked and offered for pop at exit, with conflict warnings before doing so.
* **Commit Selectively**: Instead of committing everything at once, choose exactly what to commit from the unstaged-changes dialog:
  * Per-file **checkboxes** with `+N -M` stats; the bottom pane previews the **combined diff** of the checked files, with separator lines between files (like the main diff pane)
  * **Commit Selected Files** — a single commit containing only the checked files
  * **commit --amend selected files** — amend only the checked files into the HEAD commit, with the message pre-filled from HEAD (editable)
  * **git add -p** — interactive **hunk-by-hunk** selection: pick individual hunks of the checked files, grouped per file with `Select All / Deselect All` and a live counter, then finish with `git commit` or `git commit --amend`. Unchecked hunks stay untouched in the working tree (see the full walkthrough in [docs/screenshots.md](docs/screenshots.md#18-unstaged--uncommitted-changes-handling))
  * Unchecked files stay completely untouched, and cancelling at any point leaves the repository unchanged

### 🎨 Premium User Experience

* **Adaptive Themes**: Toggle between a refined **Dark Theme** (VS Code-inspired charcoal palette) and a clean **Light Theme**.
* **Global consistency**: Every button, scrollbar, and dialog follows the chosen theme.
* **Persistent settings**: Theme, font size, and UI preferences are saved across sessions.
* **Per-window font zoom**: Adjust the code font-size with the **+/- (zoom)** buttons in the status bar.
* **Visual feedback**: Instant "Copied" notifications for clipboard actions (SHA, message, or both).
* **Resizable dialogs**: Long result/confirmation dialogs can be resized to read all the details.
* **Auto-background on launch**: When run from a terminal, the tool automatically detaches and runs in the background, returning the terminal immediately.
* **Tree view in file dialogs**: Stage files and commit staged changes dialogs include a Tree View tab with folder hierarchy, checkboxes, and stats.
* **Full Height Diff View**: Toggle button below the diff pane maximizes diff viewing area by collapsing commit details and hiding bottom controls — click again to restore.
* **Collapsible commit details**: Click the disclosure arrow (▼/▶) on the commit header to collapse/expand the message, giving more space to the diff.
* **Collapsible file lists**: Click File-wise Diff or Tree-wise Diff tab titles to toggle file list visibility. Switching to a tab auto-expands its file list; selecting a new commit resets both to collapsed.

## 🤔 Why this tool?

Interactive rebasing in Git is powerful, but repeatedly editing raw rebase todo files can become tedious during commit cleanup workflows.

This tool is designed as a lightweight visual helper around Git interactive rebase, especially useful while cleaning up a feature branch before raising a PR.

Useful when a commit accidentally contains mixed changes — for example:
feature work + debug code, code + documentation, or unrelated edits inside the same file.

### Why it is different

* **Uses native Git under the hood**

  All operations are executed using standard Git commands.
  No custom Git implementation or hidden logic.

  This also means that when Git itself improves or adds new capabilities, the tool automatically benefits from them.

* **Lightweight setup**

  No heavy installation or large Git client required.

* **Focused specifically on interactive rebase**

  Instead of being a full Git client, the tool focuses only on commit history cleanup workflows:

  * reorder/squash/split/rephrase/drop commits
  * cherry-pick commits between branches
  * refine file changes
  * move changes to new commits
  * clean up history before PR creation

**Key Strength:** Uses **native Git under the hood** — all operations are executed using standard Git commands.

## 🚀 Technical Details

* **Core**: Python 3.x
* **GUI Framework**: PySide6 (Qt)
* **Styling**: Global QSS with dynamic color mapping.
* **Git Integration**: Direct subprocess communication with the Git CLI.
* **Persistence**: `QSettings` for storing theme, font size, and UI preferences across sessions.

---

## 🛠️ Requirements & Usage

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* Git CLI installed and available in PATH (`git --version` should work).
* `PySide6` installed (`pip install PySide6`).

---

## 📦 Installation (Recommended)

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/shyjun/git-interactive-rebase-gui-tool.git
```

Then run:

```bash
git_interactive_rebase
```

---

## 🧪 Running Without Installation

If you prefer to run directly from source:

```bash
python3 git_interactive_rebase.py
```

---

## ⚙️ Command Line Arguments

The tool auto-detects the type of positional arguments (file, branch, tag, or commit ref):

```bash
python3 git_interactive_rebase.py                         # auto-detect base, show history
python3 git_interactive_rebase.py <branch>                # browse a branch (read-only)
python3 git_interactive_rebase.py <tag>                   # browse from a tag (read-only)
python3 git_interactive_rebase.py <file>                  # open file log (read-only)
python3 git_interactive_rebase.py <commit-ref>            # start from a specific commit
python3 git_interactive_rebase.py <branch> <file>         # browse branch, filtered to file
python3 git_interactive_rebase.py <tag> <file>            # browse tag, filtered to file
```

Other options:

```bash
python3 git_interactive_rebase.py --viewer-mode           # read-only viewer mode
python3 git_interactive_rebase.py -C /path/to/repo       # different repository location
python3 git_interactive_rebase.py --update                # update tool and exit
python3 git_interactive_rebase.py --version               # print version and exit
```

Detection priority for positional args: file → branch → tag → commit ref → error.

If no arguments are given, the tool automatically detects your branch base
and shows the commits since that point. If detection fails, it falls back to
the 200 most recent commits with a **Load 100 more** option to extend further.

## 🔄 Staying Updated

This project is actively under development, with new features and improvements added regularly.

### Update from inside the app

1. Click **Configure → Check for updates**.
2. If a newer version is available, click **Update Now** — a progress bar runs while the tool updates itself, then reports success or failure.
3. Restart the tool to apply the update.

#### Automatic startup check

By default, the tool checks for updates in the background when it starts. If an update is available, an **Update(\<sha\>) available** label appears in the status bar next to the **Configure** button. Click it or go to **Configure → Check for updates** to apply.

To disable this, uncheck **Configure → Check for updates at startup**. The preference is remembered across sessions.

#### Quick restart shortcut

When running from a cloned repository, press **Ctrl+Shift+F5** after updating to restart the tool with the latest code — no manual restart needed.

The update can run while the app is open; only the files on disk are changed, and the running session keeps working on the old version until you restart.

If you'd rather update later, the same dialog offers **Copy to clipboard** with the command to run manually. The app figures out how to update itself depending on how it was installed:

- **pip install** → `git_interactive_rebase --update`
- **cloned repository** → `python3 <tool-folder>/git_interactive_rebase.py --update`

For a cloned repository, the update refuses to run if your local clone has uncommitted changes — commit or stash them and try again.

### Update manually

#### If installed via pip

```bash
pip uninstall git-interactive-rebase-gui-tool
pip install git+https://github.com/shyjun/git-interactive-rebase-gui-tool.git
```

#### If installed by cloning repository

```bash
git pull
```

You can also press **Check Updates** in the app to compare the running version against the remote.

## GitHub Actions Notifications

The repository uses GitHub Actions for linting and import tests.

When the workflow fails, it can send notifications to a mobile device through:

- [Pushover](https://pushover.net/)
- [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/)

### Forking and CI notifications

If you fork this repository:

- GitHub Actions workflows are copied to your fork.
- Repository secrets are **not copied**.
- CI checks will still run, but failure notifications will not work until you configure your own notification credentials.

To enable notifications in your fork, add these repository secrets under:

**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `APP_TOKEN` | Pushover application token |
| `PUSHOVER_USER_KEY` | Pushover user key |
| `TOPIC` | ntfy topic name |

Use your own Pushover account, application token, and ntfy topic. Do not commit notification credentials to the repository.

The notification step uses `curl` to call the Pushover and ntfy HTTP APIs. No Pushover or ntfy application needs to be installed on the GitHub Actions runner.

**Security note:** An ntfy topic can act like a password when anonymous publishing is enabled. Use a private, unpredictable topic and configure authentication if the topic must remain protected.
